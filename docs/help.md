make a `WorkflowScheduler` class is designed to manage and display a set of date ranges (start and end dates) for Train, Test, and Trade. Here’s a breakdown of its functionality:
### Class Initialization (`__init__` method)
1. **Imports Configuration Constants**:
   - The constructor imports specific date constants (`TRAIN_START_DATE`, `TRAIN_END_DATE`, `TEST_START_DATE`, `TEST_END_DATE`, `TRADE_START_DATE`, `TRADE_END_DATE`) from an external configuration module `lib.rl.config`.
2. **Labels Setup**:
   - `holds labels for the different workflow modes: "Train", "Test", and "Trade".
   user display 3 colums in streamlit sidebar with heading: "Mode" "Start" "End"
   3 rows contains Mode:"Train", "Test","Trade" start date  , end dfate
   - is a label (e.g., `"Train"`, `"Test"`, `"Trade"`) and each value is a tuple containing the start and end dates for each workflow mode.
   - This dictionary associates the labels to the date constants. 
3. **Streamlit Sidebar Layout**:
   - This method is intended for use within a Streamlit app,  to display the date settings in the sidebar.
   - It uses Streamlit’s `st.sidebar` and `st.sidebar.columns` functions to create three columns:  for displaying the mode label,  for start dates, and  for end dates.
 to create input fields for the start and end dates in columns These input fields allow users to adjust dates interactively and ceate a new strings of date for usage in the app that uses the class.

1. **Setting Instance Variables**:
   - Based on the label, the method assigns the user-modified string format of "%Y-%m-%d" dates to specific instance variables (`self.train_start_date`, `self.test_start_date`, `self.trade_start_date`, etc.).
   - function is used to match the mode label (`label`) against the entries in `self.lbls` to determine which dates to store in which instance variables for later use as a string in a format = "%Y-%m-%d".

### Observations and Potential Issues

- **Duplicate Key in `self.date_ranges`**: 
  - The "Test" mode's dates are overwritten by the "Trade" mode due to using `self.lbls[1]` twice as a key in `self.date_ranges`.
  
- **Dependency on External Functions**:
  - This code relies on an external `get_date_gadget` function that presumably creates date inputs for each mode.
  
### Summary

This class provides a way to manage date ranges for different modes and display them in a Streamlit sidebar for user input. The key features include interactive start and end date inputs for each mode and updating instance variables based on user input. However, the duplication issue with the keys in `self.date_ranges` should be corrected for the "Test" mode to function properly.
