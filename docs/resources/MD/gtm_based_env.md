A **gym-based environment** or a **custom RL environment** is a simulated setting in which reinforcement learning (RL) agents can learn and make decisions by interacting with an environment that provides feedback in the form of rewards. The concept comes from OpenAI’s Gym, a toolkit for developing and comparing RL algorithms.

Here’s a breakdown of these types of environments:

### 1. **Gym-based Environment**

OpenAI Gym provides a **standardized API** for creating and interacting with different RL environments. These environments allow RL agents to learn by experimenting and receiving rewards based on their actions. Gym includes a variety of predefined environments for:

- **Classic control tasks** (e.g., CartPole, MountainCar)
- **Game playing** (e.g., Atari games)
- **Robotics simulations** (e.g., Fetch robotics tasks)
  
For trading and finance, Gym also has libraries (like `gym-anytrading`, `FinRL`, etc.) with predefined environments, making it easy to set up a paper-trading or backtesting environment. These environments provide functions like:

- `reset()`: Initializes the environment to a starting state.
- `step(action)`: Takes an action and returns the new state, reward, and whether the episode is done.
- `render()`: Visualizes the environment (often optional in trading).
  
A trading agent in a Gym environment can, for example, buy, sell, or hold an asset, with each action affecting the agent’s portfolio. The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which represent profit.

### 2. **Custom RL Environment**

A **custom RL environment** is one you build from scratch if your problem does not fit a standard Gym environment. In trading, custom environments are common because each strategy, asset, and dataset has unique features.

Building a custom RL environment typically involves:
- **Defining the State Space**: The information the agent uses to make decisions. In trading, this might be historical price data, technical indicators, or market signals.
- **Defining the Action Space**: The possible actions the agent can take. For example, an agent in a trading environment might have actions like `buy`, `sell`, or `hold`.
- **Reward Function**: This function evaluates each action based on how it impacts the goal. In trading, the reward might be a profit/loss amount, risk-adjusted return, or some other metric.
  
Custom environments must also include `reset`, `step`, and optionally `render` functions to interact with the RL algorithm.

#### Example Use Case: Gym-Based vs. Custom Environment in Trading

Suppose you want to train an RL agent to trade stocks:
- **Gym-Based Environment**: You could use a ready-made financial Gym environment like `FinRL` or `gym-anytrading`. These environments handle standard tasks like portfolio management and stock price series, saving you time.
- **Custom Environment**: If you need a specific strategy (e.g., managing multiple assets, setting leverage constraints, using high-frequency data), you would create a custom environment to tailor the state space, action space, and reward function.
